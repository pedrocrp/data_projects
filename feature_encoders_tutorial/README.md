# Feature Encoding in Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Guide
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and illustrates the various feature encoding techniques used in machine learning.

Feature encoding is a critical step in the data preprocessing pipeline for machine learning, as it transforms categorical data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand. The choice of encoding technique can significantly influence the performance of a machine learning model.

In this Notebook, we examine a range of encoding techniques, providing clear explanations of how each method works and discussing the pros and cons of each approach. The methods covered include:

- One-Hot Encoding
- Label Encoding
- Binary Encoding
- Helmert Encoding
- Hashing Encoding
- Frequency Encoding
- Target Encoding
- Weight of Evidence (WoE) Encoding
- CatBoost Encoding

For each encoding technique, i provide sample Python code to illustrate how to implement the method using the pandas and category_encoders libraries.

I have also implemented these encoding methods on a sample dataset to give a hands-on example of how each technique works in practice. In addition, we discuss important concepts such as data leakage and the importance of correctly handling train and test datasets when performing encoding.

This repository is intended for data science enthusiasts, students, and professionals who are interested in learning more about feature encoding in machine learning. The Notebook provides both a theoretical understanding of different encoding techniques and practical examples of how to implement them.
